# MIMO-STBC-Equalization-MATLAB
This project is based on analysing the BER in Almouti STBC Coding Technique and also comparing it's performance with ZF Equalization technique. I have implemented this from a research paper.

# MIMO-STBC-Equalization-MATLAB

This project focuses on enhancing data transmission rates in MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) wireless systems using Alamouti Space-Time Block Coding (STBC) and equalization techniques. The methodology employs BPSK modulation to analyze the performance of various equalizers, including Zero Forcing (ZF), through MATLAB simulations.

The study generates random binary data packets, applies digital modulation, and evaluates the system's Bit Error Rate (BER) to assess performance. By leveraging spatial multiplexing and diversity, the research aims to improve data flow and reliability in wireless communication, addressing challenges like fading and interference.

## Results

The following graphs showcase the BER performance under different configurations:

## How to Use

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Synisterflare02/MIMO-STBC-Equalization-MATLAB.git
```

Open MATLAB and run the scripts to simulate the MIMO-STBC system and observe the results.

## Future Work

- Implement advanced equalizers such as MMSE, ZF-SIC, and MMSE-SIC.
- Extend the study to higher-order modulations (e.g., QPSK, 16-QAM).
- Validate the model in real-world scenarios using hardware setups.
